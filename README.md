## About The Grafting Script

The grafting capabilities showcased here are currently a prototype and are expected to be significantly improved upon in the future as part of Privateer software. Therefore, feedback is most welcome.

The demo [grafter.py](privateer_grafting_demo/grafter.py) script is a user-friendly rendition to get Privateer to graft N-glycans onto AlphaFoldDB models with a few command line arguments.

In order to run this script, a **development version** of [Privateer](https://github.com/glycojones/privateer/tree/privateerpython) software must be obtained that is not yet officially released through [CCP4](https://www.ccp4.ac.uk/) and [CCP-EM](https://www.ccpem.ac.uk/).

**Supported operating systems by the [development version of Privateer](https://github.com/glycojones/privateer/tree/privateerpython):**
* **Linux**(tested on Ubuntu Linux 20.04)
* **MacOS**(tested on MacOS "Catalina" 10.15.5)

**Currently unsupported operating systems by the [development version of Privateer](https://github.com/glycojones/privateer/tree/privateerpython):**
* **Windows**

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Assuming a fresh installation of **Ubuntu Linux 20.04**, the following system packages need to be installed via:
```sh
sudo apt-get install cmake
sudo apt-get install bzr
sudo apt-get install virtualenv
sudo apt-get install gfortran
sudo apt-get install m4
```

On MacOS, this can be achieved via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager and running the following commands afterwards:
```sh
brew install wget
brew install cmake
brew install bzr
brew install virtualenv
brew install gfortran
brew install m4
```

After the required system packages are installed, **[development version of Privateer](https://github.com/glycojones/privateer/tree/privateerpython)** needs to be compiled and built from scratch. For the grafting demo of AlphaFoldDB models, the installation procedure is composed of 2 steps.

### **Installation of Privateer**

1. Clone Privateer repo into *privateer_python* directory:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/glycojones/privateer.git privateer_python
   ```
2. Change directory to *privateer_python*:
   ```sh
   cd privateer_python
   ```
3. Switch branch to [privateerpython](https://github.com/glycojones/privateer/tree/privateerpython) to obtain the latest developments of Privateer software:
   ```sh
   git checkout privateerpython
   ```
4. Get Privateer dependencies that are hosted on GitHub([gemmi](https://github.com/project-gemmi/gemmi), [nlohmann::json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json), [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11), [pybind11_json](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11_json)):
   ```sh
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
5. Create a virtualenv for Python3 interpreter that will contain Privateer's [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) bindings for **C++11 backend**:
   ```sh
   virtualenv privateerpython
   ```
6. Source [CCP4](https://www.ccp4.ac.uk/) environment variables that are used by Privateer's [CCP4](https://www.ccp4.ac.uk/) dependencies:
   ```sh
   source ccp4.envsetup-sh
   ```
    **CAUTION: THIS STEP HAS TO BE REPEATED EVERY TIME A NEW TERMINAL TAB/WINDOW IS OPENED**<br/>
    Secondary caution: The output of this step may appear error-like. This is normal behaviour, as shown in the following picture:
    <p align="left">
    <img src="images/ccp4sourcescriptoutput.png" alt="CCP4Source" width="923" height="183"></p>
7. Source Python3 interpreter from virtualenv that contains [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) bindings to Privateer's **C++11 backend**:
   ```sh
   source privateerpython/bin/activate
   ```
    **CAUTION: THIS STEP HAS TO BE REPEATED EVERY TIME A NEW TERMINAL TAB/WINDOW IS OPENED**
8. Install necessary Python modules through **pip3** to local **privateerpython** interpreter
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
9. Compile/build development version of Privateer along with its dependencies:
   ```sh
   python setup.py install
   ```
    Successful installation of Privateer and its dependencies in the Terminal should appear in the following way:

### **Setup of the AlphaFoldDB glycan grafting demo script**

1. In *privateer_python* directory from **substep 2** of previous installation step, clone [project_alliane](https://github.com/GABRAH/project_alliance.git) GitHub repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/GABRAH/project_alliance.git grafting_demo
   ```
2. Change directory to *grafting_demo*:
   ```sh
   cd grafting_demo
   ```
3. Change git branch to **[NatureCommunicationsDemo](https://github.com/GABRAH/project_alliance/tree/NatureCommunicationsDemo)**:
   ```sh
   git checkout NatureCommunicationsDemo
   ```

**After following these steps, the installation should be complete!**


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

### **1.) After the installation is complete, the following steps show how to prepare a fresh Terminal session to successfully run [grafter.py](privateer_grafting_demo/grafter.py) script.**
1. Change directory to *privateer_python*:
   ```sh
   cd privateer_python
   ```
2. Source [CCP4](https://www.ccp4.ac.uk/) environment variables that are used by Privateer's [CCP4](https://www.ccp4.ac.uk/) dependencies:
   ```sh
   source ccp4.envsetup-sh
   ```
3. Source Python3 interpreter from virtualenv that contains [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) bindings to Privateer's **C++11 backend**:
   ```sh
   source privateerpython/bin/activate
   ```
4. Change directory to *grafting_demo*:
   ```sh
   cd grafting_demo
   ```
5. Change directory to *privateer_grafting_demo*:
   ```sh
   cd privateer_grafting_demo
   ```

### **2.) Running [grafter.py](privateer_grafting_demo/grafter.py) script.**

1. Get all available command line arguments/flags:
   ```sh
   python grafter.py -h
   ```
2. Most convenient use of the script:
   ```sh
   python grafter.py -import_uniprotIDs_from_file uniprotIDinputs.txt
   ```
   The **"-import_uniprotIDs_from_file"** flag will import a text file containing UniProtIDs of AlphaFoldDB models that are to be N-Glycosylated. The script will make online API queries to appropriate servers to 1) **retrieve and locally save the AlphaFoldDB model** and 2) **query UniProt database to determine which amino acids to N-glycosylate**.</br>
   An [example file](privateer_grafting_demo/uniprotIDinputs.txt) is provided and users are encouraged to modify it with appropriate UniProt IDs that can be N-Glycosylated. The script is able to parse **both** _comma seperated values_ and _new line seperated values_
3. It is also possible to run the script in the offline mode(assuming that an input structure can be locally sourced):
   ```sh
   python grafter.py -local_receiver_path input/receiving_model/P29016.pdb
   ```
   If **"-uniprotID"** flag with appropriate **UniProt ID** is not provided alongside with **"-local_receiver_path"** flag, then the script will glycosylate input structure according to the following N-Glycosylation consensus sequence: **Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr**(where **Xaa** is not **Pro**) or **Asn-X-Cys**(where **X** denotes any amino acid).</br>
   **WARNING: If using this method, please make sure that the following highlighted line in the image is removed:**
    <p align="left">
    <img src="images/deletemodel0.png" alt="deleteModel0Line" width="742" height="134">If the specific line is not removed, this will cause Privateer's MMDB dependency to segfault. Online methods of the script automatically deletes the line shown on the picture above.</p>
4. Currently, by default all input AlphaFoldDB models are N-glycosylated with [Man5](privateer_grafting_demo/input/glycanblocks/man5/cluster1.pdb) glycan. In order to change the donor glycan, this can be done through the following method:
   ```sh
   python grafter.py -import_uniprotIDs_from_file uniprotIDinputs.txt -donor_path privateer_grafting_demo/input/glycanblocks/man9/cluster3.pdb
   ```
5. Simply running the script without any optional flags:
   ```sh
   python grafter.py
   ```
    Will run the script with the following default flags: 
    _-uniprotID P29016_; _-donor_path privateer_grafting_demo/input/glycanblocks/man5/cluster1.pdb_; _-download_path privateer_grafting_demo/input/receiving_model_; _-output_path privateer_grafting_demo/output_.
